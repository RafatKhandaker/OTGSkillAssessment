I am not too familiar with React.js  this is fairly new to me,

I did not complete this portion fully. I would use  a template like this to get the assignment completed but I would like to learn React.js formally to utilize this feature to it's maximum potential.

Also, I have been under duress due to multiple assignments & currently am undergoing more formal training for Dot.Net Development. Please consider, that my schedule is very tight & I am unable to squeeze this coding assessment, it was given to me at a sudden.  

Thank you  -Rafat-
